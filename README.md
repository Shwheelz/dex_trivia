# Dex Trivia
Pokedex Trivia Skill for Amazon Alexa

## Contributing
First, visit the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AI7LskV0EkqiPNXCjRh8vPAAfH-ctlHeAnQXZmXCYUg/edit?usp=sharing) for the full list of Pokemon already done or about to be implemented.

Second, write a tough question based on a Pokedex entry.  You can use [Serebii](http://www.serebii.net/pokedex-xy/) as reference.

The question needs to appear in the following format, with the correct answer FIRST.

```javascript
{
  "Which Psychic Pokemon emits alpha waves from its body that induce headaches to those who are close by?": [
    "Kadabra.",
    "Psyduck.",
    "Mr. Mime.",
    "Musharna."
  ]
},
```

Notice the all of the answers have periods next to them, commas outside the quotes, and a trailing comma at the very end.

You can submit a pull request, or, if you don't know what that is, a PM via Reddit.
